# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in JavaScript with Jest

## Overall Thoughts

I think I made an improvement on the readability of the code. The original was a bunch of nested if statments, and personally, it was hard for me to 
understand the logic behind the code at first glance. In my version, I split a lot of the logic into multiple methods. This way, it would make the "updateQuality"
method cleaner and readable. I have also included more tests for each item category!

I am open to any advice or feedback you may have!
